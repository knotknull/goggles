Google Cloud Platform Training

Intro to Google Cloud Platform

1. GCP Overview
2. GCP Services
3. Beyond Services

## Innovation
 - BigTable: structured storage built on GFS / Colossus
 - Spanner:  planet scale DB, externally-consistent distributed transactions
 - GCS (built on Colossus): Google Cloud Storage
 - BigQuery (from Dremmel )


Google hires Site Reliability Engineers (read for free)

## GCP Structure and Design
############################

Design Principles
 - Global
 - Secure
 - Huge Scale
 - For Devs

Cloud Locations:
https://cloud.google.com/about/locations/#regions-tab

GCP intrinsically global
  - Global model
  - Easier to handle latency and failures in global way
  - Could be more sensitive to multi-region / global failure modes

AWS is intrinsically region-scoped
  - Regional model
  - Simplifies data sovereignty

## Physical Infrastructure
  - vCPU > Physical Server > Rack > Data Center > Zone > Region > Multi-Region
    (each region in Multi-Region is at least 100 miles away from others)
    - Private Global Network
    - Points of Presence (POPs) - Network edges and CDN locations

## Network Ingress & Egress
  - Normal network: routes via Internet to edge location closest to destination

  - Google network: routes so traffic enters from Internet at edge closes to source
    - Single global IP address can be load balanced worldwide
    - Side steup DNS issues

  - Can now opt for "normal" network routing to reduce price (and function)

## Pricing
  - Provisioned:  Make sure you're ready to hande X
  - Usage:  Make sure you're ready to hande X
  - Network Traffic
      - Free ingress
      - Charged egress, by GBs used
      - Egress to GCP services sometimes free
          - Depends on the destination service
          - Depends on the location of that service

## Security
  - Separation of duties and physical security
  - Everything always encrypted at rest
  - Strong key and identity management
  - Network encryption
      - All control info encrypted
      - All WAN traffic to be encrypted automatically
      - Moving towards encrypting all local traffic within data centers
  - Distrust the network anyway!?!
      - BeyondCorp shifts access control from network perimeter to devices / users

## Scale and Automation
  - Scalability must be unbounded
  - Devs don't want to answer pages

## Resource Quotas (Soft Limits)
  - Scope
     - Regional
     - Global
  - Changes
     - Automatic
     - By request
        - response in 24-48 hrs
        - may be refused
  - Queryable
      gcloud compute project-info describe --project myprojectid

## Organization
   - Projects are similar to AWS accounts
   - Projects own resources
   - Resources can be shared with other projects
   - Projects can be grouped and controlled in a hierarchy
